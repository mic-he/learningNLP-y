Tutorials about deep learning with Keras.

This is mostly intended as self-teaching material. Most of the code comes from other sources (credits in each notebook).

1) Text classification with Keras: the notebook explores a few deep learning approaches to binary sentiment classification on three datasets of reviews (imdb, yelp, amazon), including loading pre-trained glove word embeddings

2) Sentiment classification with Keras: the notebook, based on official Keras examples,  explores several deep learning approaches to binary sentiment classification on the imdb dataset.

3) FastText with Keras: the notebook follows up on the previous one, exploring imdb sentiment classification on top of fastText feature engineering.

4) Neural Language modeling with Keras: the notebook contains a few toy examples of neural language modeling in Keras.
