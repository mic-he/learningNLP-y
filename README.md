# learningNLP-y
Tutorials about NLP with Python: a bunch of Jupyter notebooks in which I try to teach myself the basics of scikit-learn, nltk, gensim, spacy, keras and pytorch.

Basics:

Text analysis and NLP with Spacy and NLTK, classification with scikit-learn.

Keras:

1) Text classification with Keras: the notebook explores a few deep learning approaches to binary sentiment classification on three datasets of reviews (imdb, yelp, amazon), including loading pre-trained glove word embeddings

2) Sentiment classification with Keras: the notebook, based on official Keras examples,  explores several deep learning approaches to binary sentiment classification on the imdb dataset.

3) FastText with Keras: the notebook follows up on the previous one, exploring imdb sentiment classification on top of fastText feature engineering.

4) Neural Language modeling with Keras: the notebook contains a few toy examples of neural language modeling in Keras.


PyTorch:

1) Introduction to PyTorch

2) Classification of names with RNNs

3) Name generation with RNNs

4) Neural machine translation with attention
